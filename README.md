Palindrome.py attempts to find the longest palindrome within a string
I used re to make the string lower case and remove punctuation to make sure it addressed 
the following use cases:
   >palindromes with whitespace & palindromes with punctuation in between

# palindrome_test.py 

>tested for different cases using pytest
>testing for empty string
>testing for single character string
>testing for even char in string
>testing for odd char in string
>testing for white space
>testing for punctuation
